# EFPSE-CE video converter v1.0

### A tool to convert videos for use with EFPSE-CE

Currently uses a custom format similar to M-JPEG, which results in large files but fast decompression speeds.  
There is currently no audio track support.  

High compression levels will reduce quality and file size.  

Future plans:  
\- Audio support.  
\- VP8 video compression.  

Uses [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org) for conversion.
