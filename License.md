# The ***I'm too stupid to understand software licenses*** license

I'm not a lawyer, nor do I have the time or interest in learning all the tiny details about international copyright, the GPL, the LGPL, or ffmpeg's licensing requirements.  
Whatever least-restrictive license allows me to bundle a copy of ffmpeg and use it in this code is the license that applies to this project.  
Because I have no idea what I'm doing, you have full permission to relicense your copy of this software with whatever license you want.  
If CC0 is compatible with this specific usage of ffmpeg, then that's the license I'm releasing this under.  
I'm not a lawyer and I don't care about copyright law.  
If this code isn't using ffmpeg in a way that fits their license, let me know what the issue is so I can fix it.  
Do what you want with this project. Download, copy, modify, share, relicense, sell, claim it as your own, print it on a sheet of paper and shove it up your ass, I don't care, this 'license' text took longer to write.  
It's your responsibility to make sure your copy/fork/whatever is compatible with the ffmpeg license conditions.  
Obviously this license only applies to the code/words that I've written in this repo, and not the ffmpeg code/binary.  
The terrible .vid file format that this program creates is licensed as cc0.
