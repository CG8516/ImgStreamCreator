# 🖕🖕🖕 The ***Fuck licenses*** license 🖕🖕🖕  

### Fuck copyright.  
### Fuck copyleft.  
### Fuck the GPL.  
#### I'm here to write code, not spread your political/copyright views.  

I'm not a lawyer, nor do I have the time or interest in learning about the intrinsics of international copyright, the GPL, the LGPL, or ffmpeg's licensing requirements.  
Whatever least-restrictive license allows me to bundle a copy of ffmpeg and use it in this code is the license that applies to this project.  
If it's possible to release this as CC0 or with the MIT expat license, then I pick either of those.  
If this code isn't using ffmpeg in a way that fits their shitty license, let me know what the issue is so I can fix it.  
Do what you want with this project. Download, copy, modify, share, relicense, sell, claim it as your own, print it on a sheet of paper and shove it up your ass, I don't fucking care, this license took longer to write.  
It's your responsibility to make sure your copy/fork/whatever is compatible with the ffmpeg license conditions.  
My only license condition is as that I can't be held liable for anything that happens as a direct or indirect result of this project existing.  
Obviously this license only applies to the code I've written, and not the ffmpeg code or binary.  
The terrible .vid file format that this program creates is in the public domain.
